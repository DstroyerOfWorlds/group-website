        <p>Congratulations everyone, I really mean it. Not only were y'all able to divide the server over petty fucking bullshit, but you also managed to run off the great motherfucker that created this place and brought y'all together. All because y'all just couldn't let it the fuck go and shut the fuck up. Doc says that he won't be returning to this fucking shitshow now. So as of now consider this shit the wild fucking west do whatever the fuck y'all want, no rules for anybody. You wanna be a piece of shit be a piece of shit. Wanna disrespect each other and stir up shit? Be my fucking guest. Y'all are lucky this entire server isn't deleted although it may as well be at this point. Y'all destroyed a good thing, broke mine and Doc's hearts and showed a callous disrespect for him. Hope you're fucking happy. He's gone and so am I. I will not be taking questions at this time.</p>
